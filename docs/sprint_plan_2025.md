### Sprint 2: Coverage Analysis Enhancement (Priority: High)
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive coverage measurement and analysis

#### Tasks

1. **Multi-Tool Coverage Analysis**
   ```rust
   // Implement comprehensive coverage measurement
   use std::process::Command;

   fn measure_coverage() -> Result<CoverageMetrics, Box<dyn Error>> {
       // Run multiple coverage tools for cross-validation
       let tarpaulin = Command::new("cargo").args(&["tarpaulin", "--out", "Html"])
           .output()?;

       let grcov = Command::new("cargo").args(&["build", "--profile", "coverage"])
           .output()?;

       // Analyze feature-specific coverage
       let simd_coverage = measure_feature_coverage("simd")?;
       let gpu_coverage = measure_feature_coverage("gpu")?;

       Ok(CoverageMetrics {
           tarpaulin: parse_tarpaulin_output(&tarpaulin.stdout),
           grcov: parse_grcov_output(&grcov.stdout),
           feature_specific: FeatureCoverage { simd_coverage, gpu_coverage },
       })
   }
   ```

2. **Feature-Specific Coverage Analysis**
   - Measure coverage for individual feature flags
   - Identify unreachable code paths due to conditional compilation
   - Analyze test coverage gaps in optional features
   - Implement targeted tests for low-coverage modules

3. **Integration Test Coverage**
   - Develop integration test scenarios for complex workflows
   - Measure end-to-end coverage for CSG operations
   - Validate coverage for error handling paths
   - Implement property-based testing for edge cases

#### Success Criteria
- ✅ Multiple coverage tools provide consistent measurements
- ✅ Feature-specific coverage analysis completed
- ✅ Integration test coverage assessment implemented
- ✅ Coverage gaps identified and documented

### Sprint 3: WASM Feature Resolution (Priority: Medium)
**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Objective**: Resolve WASM compilation issues and establish minimal viable WASM support

#### Tasks

1. **Dependency Conflict Resolution**
   - Analyze WASM-incompatible dependencies (DXF, image processing)
   - Implement conditional compilation for WASM targets
   - Create WASM-compatible feature subset
   - Resolve random number generation issues

2. **Minimal WASM Implementation**
   ```rust
   // WASM-compatible feature configuration
   #[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
   pub mod wasm_compat {
       // Exclude dependencies requiring system resources
       // Implement core CSG operations without file I/O
       // Provide JavaScript-compatible API bindings
   }
   ```

3. **WASM Validation Framework**
   - Implement WASM-specific test suite
   - Validate core CSG operations in WASM environment
   - Performance benchmarking for WASM builds
   - Cross-platform compatibility verification

#### Success Criteria
- ✅ WASM compilation successful with minimal feature set
- ✅ Core CSG operations functional in WASM environment
- ✅ WASM-specific test suite passing
- ✅ Performance characteristics documented for WASM builds

### Sprint 4: Performance Benchmarking Infrastructure (Priority: Medium)
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Objective**: Establish comprehensive performance monitoring and regression detection

#### Tasks

1. **Enhanced Benchmark Suite**
   ```rust
   // Comprehensive benchmarking with multiple configurations
   #[cfg(feature = "simd")]
   fn benchmark_simd_vs_scalar() -> BenchmarkResult {
       let scalar_result = benchmark_operation("scalar", || {
           perform_csg_operation()
       });

       let simd_result = benchmark_operation("simd", || {
           perform_csg_operation_simd()
       });

       BenchmarkResult {
           scalar_performance: scalar_result,
           simd_performance: simd_result,
           speedup_ratio: scalar_result.time / simd_result.time,
       }
   }
   ```
