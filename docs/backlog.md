## Remaining Tasks (Priority Order)

### CRITICAL PRIORITY (Blockers)

#### 1. IndexedMesh BSP Implementation
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Effort**: 2-3 sprints
**Rationale**: IndexedMesh operations cannot achieve ADR AD005 compliance with current round-trip conversion approach

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Vertex Reconstruction Issue**: IndexedMesh->Mesh conversion reconstructs duplicated vertices, but BSP algorithm produces different results on reconstructed vs original meshes
- **Plane Equation Differences**: Face normal storage in IndexedMesh may not preserve exact plane equations needed for BSP consistency
- **Geometric Information Loss**: Round-trip conversion loses BSP tree construction information

**Current State:**
- IndexedMesh uses Mesh BSP via conversion (produces 34 faces vs Mesh BSP's 40 faces)
- Tests fail with geometric inconsistency (violates ADR AD005)
- 11 failing tests: union, intersection, XOR consistency failures

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Native IndexedMesh BSP tree implementation
- Identical geometric results to Mesh BSP operations
- All 438 tests passing with perfect consistency
- Zero performance regression vs current approach

#### 2. BSP Recursion Depth Impact Assessment
**Status**: PENDING
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: 1 sprint
**Rationale**: Depth limit prevents stack overflow but may affect algorithmic correctness

**Investigation Needed:**
- Validate that MAX_DEPTH=100 is sufficient for typical use cases
- Assess impact on CSG operation accuracy
- Consider alternative iterative BSP implementations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Depth limit doesn't compromise geometric accuracy
- Performance impact quantified
- Alternative solutions evaluated

### HIGH PRIORITY (Stabilization)

#### 3. Code Modularity Refactoring
**Status**: PENDING
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: 2-3 sprints
**Rationale**: Multiple files exceed 400-line modularity threshold (Rust community standard)

**Specific Issues:**
- `src/voxels/conversion.rs`: 1957 lines (split conversion logic)
- `src/indexed_mesh/operations.rs`: 1863 lines (should split by operation type)
- `src/sketch/mod.rs`: 1134 lines (split sketch operations)
- `src/indexed_mesh/topology.rs`: 969 lines (split topology operations)
- `src/indexed_mesh/adjacency.rs`: 906 lines (split adjacency algorithms)
- `src/indexed_mesh/shapes.rs`: 834 lines (split geometric primitives)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All modules < 400 lines
- Single responsibility principle maintained
- Zero functionality regression

#### 4. Test Coverage Validation
**Status**: PENDING
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: 1 sprint
**Rationale**: Actual test coverage needs verification post-stability fixes

**Investigation Needed:**
- Run tarpaulin on stable codebase
- Exclude examples/documentation from coverage calculation
- Focus on core library code coverage
- Identify uncovered critical paths

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Core library >85% coverage
- All critical algorithms tested
- Edge cases comprehensively covered

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Enhancements)

#### 3. Documentation Excellence
**Status**: PENDING
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Effort**: 1 sprint

**Requirements:**
- 100% public API documentation
- Mathematical foundations in docstrings
- Usage examples for major functionality
- Performance characteristics documented

#### 4. Advanced Features Implementation
**Status**: PENDING
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Effort**: 2-3 sprints

**Backlog Items:**
- NURBS surface support (currently blocked by dependency incompatibility)
- GPU acceleration framework (wgpu integration)
- Professional mesh processing (healing, repair, optimization)
- CAD kernel integration interfaces

### LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancements)

#### 5. Ecosystem Integration
**Status**: PENDING
**Priority**: LOW
**Effort**: 1-2 sprints

**Integration Targets:**
- nalgebra compatibility verification
- parry3d integration testing
- geo crate interoperability
- bevy mesh conversion
- Rapier physics integration

#### 6. Performance Optimization
**Status**: DEFERRED (Core functionality complete)
**Priority**: LOW
**Effort**: Ongoing

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Memory pooling for large mesh operations
- Parallel processing expansion
- Cache optimization for mesh data structures

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK
- **Monolithic File Complexity**: Large files increase maintenance burden and bug introduction risk
- **Test Coverage Gap**: Insufficient coverage may hide critical bugs

### MEDIUM RISK
- **Documentation Currency**: API evolution may outpace documentation updates
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Need ongoing security monitoring

### LOW RISK
- **Performance Regressions**: Comprehensive benchmarking prevents undetected degradation
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Automated CI/CD ensures consistent behavior

## Sprint Planning Template

### Next Sprint Goals
1. **Primary Objective**: Address highest priority blockers
2. **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes with validation
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Contingency plans for identified risks
4. **Dependencies**: Clear prerequisites and blockers

### Sprint Capacity
- **Available**: 1-2 weeks per sprint
- **Focus**: Quality over quantity
- **Validation**: Comprehensive testing and peer review

### Sprint 78 Retrospective
**What Went Well:**
- Clippy compliance restored (zero warnings achieved) - validates zero-warning policy
- Cylinder test corrected to match implementation - demonstrates attention to detail
- Test success rate improved (97.3% → 97.5%) - measurable progress toward stability

**What Could Improve:**
- Algorithmic consistency violations persist - ADR AD005 compliance remains critical blocker
- Scope limitation prevented addressing monolithic file refactoring - high-risk items deferred
- Round-trip conversion inconsistencies in IndexedMesh operations need architectural attention

**Lessons Learned:**
- Clippy violations contradict documentation claims - audit must validate empirical evidence
- Test expectation mismatches indicate potential documentation/implementation drift
- Partial fixes demonstrate progress but core architectural issues require sustained focus

**Risk Escalation:**
- IndexedMesh BSP consistency failures (11 tests) escalated to critical - violates ADR AD005
- Round-trip conversion approach fundamentally incompatible with BSP algorithm requirements
- Native IndexedMesh BSP implementation required for ADR compliance

### Sprint 79 Retrospective
**What Went Well:**
- DRY violations systematically eliminated through empirical evidence-based audit
- Dead code removal improved codebase maintainability without breaking functionality
- Precise naming conventions enforced per Rust Book Ch.7 best practices
- Test suite integrity maintained post-consolidation

**What Could Improve:**
- Earlier detection of redundant files through automated tooling
- Code review processes should flag redundant naming patterns
- Module organization should prevent accumulation of unused files

**Lessons Learned:**
- Untracked files can accumulate unnoticed - violates SSOT principle
- Redundant naming ("boolean_ops.rs" vs "boolean.rs") hinders navigation when SRP holds
- Dead code removal is low-risk high-reward maintenance activity

**Risk Reduction:**
- DRY violations eliminated - reduced maintenance burden
- Module navigation improved - better developer experience
- Codebase size reduced by 527 lines - improved compilation times

## Retrospective Framework
