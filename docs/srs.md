### Technical Fixes Applied

#### Cylinder Normal Transformation Fix
**Problem**: Cylinder face normals were not being updated during transformations, causing incorrect lighting and rendering after rotations/scaling.

**Solution**:
- Modified `transform()` function in `src/indexed_mesh/operations.rs` to properly transform face normals using inverse transpose matrix
- Face normals now maintain correct orientation after translation, rotation, and scaling operations
- All cylinder face types (radial sides, axial top/bottom) preserve mathematical correctness

#### STL Export Triangulation Fix
**Problem**: STL export test expected same face count as original mesh, but STL triangulates quad faces into multiple triangles.

**Solution**:
- Updated test in `src/indexed_mesh/mod.rs` to calculate expected triangle count: `face.vertices.len() - 2` for each face
- For 10-segment cylinder: 10 quads (20 triangles) + 20 triangles (20 triangles) = 40 triangles total
- Test now validates correct STL triangulation behavior

### Quality Assurance Validation
